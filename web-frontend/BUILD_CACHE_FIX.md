# Next.js Build Cache Issue - Fixed ✅

## Issue

Multiple errors were occurring after recent changes:
- `GET /_next/static/css/app/layout.css` 404 (Not Found)
- `GET /_next/static/chunks/main-app.js` 404 (Not Found)
- `GET /_next/static/chunks/app-pages-internals.js` 404 (Not Found)
- `sw-register.js` Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined

## Root Cause

**Stale Next.js Build Cache**: The `.next` directory contained outdated build artifacts from before the recent API route changes. When the server was restarted, it tried to serve these old files that no longer matched the current codebase.

## Solution

Cleared the Next.js build cache and restarted the dev server:

```bash
# Kill any running process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Remove .next directory to clear cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## Why This Worked

1. **Clean Build**: Removing `.next` forces Next.js to rebuild everything from scratch
2. **Updated Routes**: The new API route changes (using `request.nextUrl` and `await params`) are now properly compiled
3. **Fresh Assets**: All static chunks, CSS, and JavaScript files are regenerated with the correct paths

## Current Status

✅ **All Pages Working**:
- Homepage: http://localhost:3000
- Marketplace: http://localhost:3000/marketplace
- Product Category: http://localhost:3000/marketplace/product
- Livestock Category: http://localhost:3000/marketplace/livestock
- Equipment Category: http://localhost:3000/marketplace/equipment

✅ **API Routes Working**:
- `/api/marketplace` - Returns data with real Unsplash images
- `/api/marketplace/[category]` - Category filtering working
- `/api/marketplace/[category]/[id]` - Details page with ObjectId validation

## Prevention

When experiencing similar issues after code changes:

1. **Clear Build Cache**: `rm -rf .next`
2. **Restart Dev Server**: Stop and restart `npm run dev`
3. **Hard Refresh Browser**: Clear browser cache or use incognito mode

## Summary

The issues were caused by a stale build cache, not by the code changes themselves. After clearing the cache and rebuilding, everything works perfectly!

**Status**: ✅ Fully Fixed and Working
