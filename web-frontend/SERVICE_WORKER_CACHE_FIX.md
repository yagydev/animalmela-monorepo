# Service Worker Cache Issue - Fixed âœ…

## Issue

**Error**: `FetchEvent for "http://localhost:3000/_next/static/css/app/layout.css?v=1761232798331" resulted in a network error`

The browser's Service Worker was caching old file versions that no longer exist after the build cache was cleared.

## Root Cause

**Stale Service Worker Cache**: When we cleared the `.next` directory, the browser's Service Worker still had cached references to old files:

- Old cached version: `v=1761232798331`
- New build version: `v=1761277092994` (or similar)

The Service Worker was trying to fetch files that don't exist anymore.

## Solution

Cleared all cached files and rebuilt:

```bash
# Kill any running server
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Remove all cached files including service worker files
rm -rf .next public/sw.js public/workbox-*.js public/fallback-*.js

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## How to Fix Manually (if needed)

If you still see this error in your browser:

1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application tab**
3. **Click "Service Workers"** in the left sidebar
4. **Click "Unregister"** for any registered service workers
5. **Go to "Storage"**
6. **Click "Clear site data"**
7. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## Why This Happens

Next.js PWA plugin generates Service Worker files that cache static assets. When you:
- Clear the `.next` directory
- Update dependencies
- Change configuration

The old Service Worker may reference files that no longer exist.

## Prevention

When deploying or making significant changes:

1. **Clear build cache**: `rm -rf .next`
2. **Clear Service Worker**: Unregister old SW in browser
3. **Hard refresh**: Force browser to reload everything
4. **Use incognito**: Test in fresh environment

## Current Status

âœ… **Fixed**: All Service Worker files regenerated
âœ… **Working**: Fresh build with new file versions
âœ… **Clean**: No more cache mismatches

## Summary

The Service Worker was caching old file versions. After clearing all cached files and rebuilding, everything works correctly! ðŸŽ‰
